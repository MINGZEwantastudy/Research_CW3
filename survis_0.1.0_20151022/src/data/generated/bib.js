        "abstract": "Our study examines the relationship between information alignment (IA), collaboration (CO) and supply chain agility (SCAG) under the moderating effects of artificial intelligence-driven big data analytics capability (AI-BDAC) and intergroup leadership (IGL). We have grounded our theoretical model in the resource-based view (RBV) and contingency theory and further tested our research hypotheses using multi-informant data collected using a web-based pre-tested instrument from 613 individuals working in 193 humanitarian organisations drawn from 24 countries located on various continents across the globe. We tested our research hypotheses using variance-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Our study offers interesting results which help to advance the theoretical debates surrounding technology-driven supply chain agility in the context of humanitarian settings. We further provide some directions to managers engaged in disaster relief operations, who are contemplating using emerging technologies to enhance collaboration and supply chain agility. Finally, we have outlined the limitations of our study and offer some future research directions.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the research was to establish data relating to underlying causes of human error which are the most common cause of information security incidents within a private sector healthcare organization. A survey questionnaire was designed to proactively apply the IS-CHEC information security human reliability analysis (HRA) technique. The IS-CHEC technique questionnaire identified the most likely core human error causes that could result in incidents, their likelihood, the most likely tasks that could be affected, suggested remedial and preventative measures, systems or processes that would be likely to be affected by human error and established the levels of risk exposure. The survey was operational from 15th November 2018 to 15th December 2018. It achieved a response rate of 65% which equated to 485 of 749 people targeted by the research. The research found that, in the case of this particular participating organization, the application of the IS-CHEC technique through a questionnaire added beneficial value as an enhancement to a standard approach of holistic risk assessment. The research confirmed that the IS-CHEC in questionnaire form can be successfully applied within a private sector healthcare organization and also that a distributed approach for information security human error assessment can be successfully undertaken in order to add beneficial value. The results of this paper indicate, from the questionnaire responses supplied by employees, that organizational focus on its people and their working environment can improve information security posture and reduce the likelihood of associated information security incidents through a reduction in human error.",

        "abstract": "Context: The recurrence of past security breaches in healthcare showed that lessons had not been effectively learned across different healthcare organisations. Recent studies have identified the need to improve learning from incidents and to share security knowledge to prevent future attacks. Generic Security Templates (GSTs) have been proposed to facilitate this knowledge transfer. The objective of this paper is to evaluate whether potential users in healthcare organisations can exploit the GST technique to share lessons learned from security incidents. Methodology: We conducted a series of case studies to evaluate GSTs. In particular, we used a GST for a security incident in the US Veterans' Affairs Administration to explore whether security lessons could be applied in a very different Chinese healthcare organisation. Results: The results showed that Chinese security professional accepted the use of GSTs and that cyber security lessons could be transferred to a Chinese healthcare organisation using this approach. The users also identified the weaknesses and strengths of GSTs, providing suggestions for future improvements. Conclusion: Generic Security Templates can be used to redistribute lessons learned from security incidents. Sharing cyber security lessons helps organisations consider their own practices and assess whether applicable security standards address concerns raised in previous breaches in other countries. The experience gained from this study provides the basis for future work in conducting similar studies in other healthcare organisations.",

        "abstract": "Security incidents can have negative impacts on healthcare organizations, and the security of medical records has become a primary concern of the public. However, previous studies showed that organizations had not effectively learned lessons from security incidents. Incident learning as an essential activity in the \u201cfollow-up\u201d phase of security incident response lifecycle has long been addressed but not given enough attention. This paper conducted a case study in a healthcare organization in China to explore their current obstacles in the practice of incident learning. We interviewed both IT professionals and healthcare professionals. The results showed that the organization did not have a structured way to gather and redistribute incident knowledge. Incident response was ineffective in cycling incident knowledge back to inform security management. Incident reporting to multiple stakeholders faced a great challenge. In response to this case study, we suggest the security assurance modeling framework to address those obstacles.",

        "abstract": "Recent industrial reports show an increased number of cybersecurity incidents, which inflict significant financial losses. Although organisations have been increasing their investments towards information security, incidents continue to occur. Most organisations adopt traditional linear incident response (IR) frameworks to prevent, detect, contain, eradicate and learn lessons from information security incidents. However, due to their rigidness, such linear frameworks are often ineffective. In this study, inspired by the Agile Manifesto, we propose the Agile IR Framework to refine, adjust, and improve the current linear IR process. We use the IR framework of UK's National Health Service (NHS) as an illustrative case, critically analysing the current linear IR framework and demonstrating how it can be transformed into a hybrid IR framework. Using an illustrative case study from the healthcare domain, this study contributes to the incident response literature by showcasing how the integration of Agile principles in archetypical linear IR processes can improve incident response.",

        "abstract": "The healthcare information system (HIS) has become a victim of cyberattacks. Traditional ways to handle cyber incidents in healthcare organizations follow a predefined incident response (IR) procedure. However, this procedure is usually reactive, missing the opportunities to foresee danger on the horizon. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) contains information on emerging attacks and should be ideally utilized to inform the IR procedure. However, current research shows that the IR has not been effectively informed by CTI, especially in healthcare organizations. This paper fills in this gap by proposing a proactive IR response procedure based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) IR methodology. This paper then presents the NHS WannaCry case study to demonstrate the use of the proposed IR methodology. We collate cyber security advisories from different CTI sources such as US/UK CERT to protect interconnected systems and devices from Ransomware attacks. This research provides novel insights into the IR in healthcare through embedding CTI advisories into IR processes and concludes that our proposed IR procedure can be used to counteract WannaCry Ransomware using CTI advisories. It has the significance of transforming the way of IR from reactive to proactive using the CTI in healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Cyber incident response within Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is characterised by high levels of uncertainty and unpredictability and requires a multi-disciplined team that encompasses personnel business operations, Operational Technology (OT), IT, security operations and media engagement to be effective. Such teams require a dynamic decision framework to allow ICS operators to maintain services during the recovery of full operating capability. There is empirical evidence that static incident response playbooks do not provide enough flexibility in their definition to support situations outside of the scope of their initial definition, and that they have been ignored when cyber incidents have occurred. A thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with ICS incident response professional identified three main areas of concern: communication, information sharing between knowledge areas, and achieving external buy-in. The Agile Incident Response for Industrial Control Systems (AIR4ICS) framework has been developed to integrate Agile techniques into the Cyber Security domain of incident response. AIR4ICS provides a dynamic approach to improve situational awareness, information sharing, collective decision-making and response flexibility within the unique context of ICS. The techniques used in AIR4ICS were initially shaped by interviews with professionals with experience of protecting ICS, structured using the Scrum methodology, and refined through a series of Cyber Incident Response exercises with Incident Response professionals facing-off against specialist ICS Red Teams. AIR4ICS has resulted in a framework that provides a modular approach that can be adapted to fit the working practices, skillsets and priorities of individual organisations. The framework improves communication, promotes information sharing between knowledge areas, and increases external buy-in. Ultimately, AIR4ICS provides a dynamic decision framework that allows Incident Response Teams to manage uncertainty and unpredictability to reduce the time taken to restore normal operations.",
